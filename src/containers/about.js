                    I&apos;m a front-end developer with over 4 years experience in web development.
                    I have worked with ReactJS for at least 2 years.
                    In past 2 years, my main task is participating in a new project independently.
                    I build the project up individually.
                    Further, I also have to co-work with foreign colleagues and be in charge of front-end technique consulting job.
                    I&apos;m an extremely persistent and flexible person.
                    Often raise new ideas for projects and take the initiative in filling the deficiency of orignal architecture.
                    Otherwise, I also have lots experiences in lagacy code maintenance and refinement.
                    I&apos;m adaptable to handle any situation.
                    I&apos;m a young girl but I always try my best.
                    I&apos;m glad to learn front-end new knowledge to cover my shortage in the job.
                    The process in solving challenges make me feel fullfeeled and satisfied.
